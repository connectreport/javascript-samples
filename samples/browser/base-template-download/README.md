# ConnectReport.js Base Template Download Sample
This sample demonstrates the end to end flow of providing a base template ID to the client, running a task on a copy of the base template, and downloading a final generated PDF. 

## Configuration
You will need a base template configured on your server, and an API key for a user that has access to the base template. 

Once you have those, navigate to `/index.js` and set the constant values defined at the top to the appropriate values.
